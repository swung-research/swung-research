# SWUNG Research

Swung research is the place for research projects, cross-community joint projects and other collaborations that involve several communities. It is a neutral place for collaborations. It is meant for research output, publications, books, and so much more. It is, sort of, a "writing" companion to the main [github.com/softwareunderground](https://github.com/softwareunderground) GitHub (which is more the traditional software place). Projects in here are probably very lively until submission, and then remain unchanged.
