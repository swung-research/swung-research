# SWUNG Research

An archive of research output, publications, books, and so much more. It is, sort of, a static companion to the main github.com/softwareunderground GitHub. Stuff in here will get uploaded once, and maybe changed once or twice (in a review process), but then stays as it is.

It is a good place to put these static outputs for cross-community efforts, where there is no obvious place in which of those communities it should be hosted.
